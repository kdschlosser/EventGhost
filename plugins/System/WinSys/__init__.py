            Refreshes environment variables by reading their current
            values from the registry.

            When a program launches, it inherits the current environment
            from the program that launched it, and EventGhost is no
            different. By default, if you modify an environment variable,
            EventGhost won't pass your changes along to the programs it
            launches because it doesn't know those changes took place. If
            you update your %PATH%, for example, then open a Command
            Prompt from EventGhost, you'll find you're unable to run
            commands from the new folders you've added.

            In the past, the only solution to this problem was to restart
            EventGhost. Now, with the aid of this action (or "Refresh
            environment before executing Run actions" in Options), EventGhost
            can read the latest environment variables from the registry,
            apply them to its own environment, and thereby pass them along
            to anything it launches going forward.
